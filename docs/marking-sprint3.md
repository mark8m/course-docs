# Team Project Marking: Sprint 3

In this sprint, you will continue working on the codebase and tests. You will also focus on UI and UX design.

During the last week of this sprint, you will demo your prototype to your classmates (science fair style).

## Late release submission policy

_Applies to all sprints._

If a sprint release is late for less than 24 hours: penalty of 5 marks.

If late for more than 24 hours: penalty at the instuctor's discretion, min. 10 marks.

## Rubric

| Deliverable     | Marks   |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Revisions       | 10      |
| UX, UI design   | 20      |
| Codebase        | 25      |
| Testing         | 10      |
| Sprint planning | 10      |
| Teamwork        | 15      |
| Wildcard        | 10      |
| **Total**       | **100** |


_**Revisions**, **Codebase**, **Teamwork**, and **Wildcard** deliverables are similar to the ones in the previous sprint._

### UX, UI design

* Product user interface is consistent
* UX (user experience) is well thought-out and designed for the target audience
* UI design principles and usability heuristics are applied and described in the docs (e.g. <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/>)
* Accessibility is considered and described in the docs (e.g. colors pass contrast check, see <https://www.alarmsystem.no/color-contrast/>)

### Testing
* Tests exist and run for (as many as possible of) the demonstrated functionalities
    * Tests should be Acceptance Tests for testing user stories from the user's point-of-view
    * Tests should be labelled with what user story they're for
    * Tests should be tracked in a "Requirements Traceability Matrix"
    * Tests should include success and failure scenarios (e.g. test good password and bad password)
    * Tests should ideally be user interface tests using UI test automation tools (e.g. selenium for web UIs)
    * API should be tested if applicable
    * Unit tests (tests per function, method, class in the code) are **not** required
* At least one self-hosted Runner for Github Actions is setup


### Sprint planning

* Storymap clearly represents the current state of the project
* Project plan is updated to reflect the current state of the project
* Velocity is re-estimated for Sprints 4 and 5
* Sprint 4 tasks are included in the project plan (in their own section, separate of the team canvas)
* Detailed Github Issues for Sprint 4 correspond with the storymap and project plan, have relevant states, milestones, labels and assignees
